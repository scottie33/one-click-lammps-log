after .dcd loaded by vmd: source doit.tcl


you can use the following cli to see your data-fig:
1, readlog.py
3, create_html.bash 
just hit them in your command line to see 'how to'

e.g.:

./readlog.py example.log
./create_html.bash example.gnuplot.dat (this file is created by the last command)

or 

./readlog.py example.log Step example.inputfornextcmd 
./create_html.bash example.inputfornextcmd

Attention:

1, for the [keyword], we shall set it the 1st keyword of dump keywords in your .log file, normally "Step"
2, nothing more so far...
